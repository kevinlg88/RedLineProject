40,,"The girl smiles at Kotaro, showing herself quite grateful for the situation."
41,,"Kotaro smiles back and goes to his room."
42,Haruna,"Sayu, did you find that girl familiar too?"
43,Sayumi,"I may be wrong, but I think I know her."
44,,Sayumi remains thoughtful.
45,Sayumi,"""A girl like that in an expensive kimono in the middle of the street at night... She's not poor like us..."""
46,,Haruna starts to yawn.
47,Haruna,"Sayu, I'm getting sleepy. I'm going to sleep and tomorrow we'll talk more!"
48,Sayumi,"Let's go. Good night, Haruna-chan."

57,Kotaro,"Wow, as we had a lot of customers today. The night shift starts in a little while..."
58,Sayumi,"Kotaro, the girl you brought hasn't left her room yet. Wouldn't it be nice to check that she's okay?"
59,Kotaro,"It's true… I'm going there now. Sayumi, can you please start organizing everything for the night shift while I do this?"
60,Sayumi,No problem. Haruna and I will take care of everything.
61,,Kotaro goes to the girl's room to check and she is still sleeping.
62,Girl,"Kotaro, is that you?"
63,Kotaro,"Yes, are you okay? Did you sleep well?"
64,,The girl gets up and looks fine.
65,Girl,"Well, I think I owe you an explanation..."
66,Girl,"My name is Sakura, the reason I'm running away is that my brother was after me... He almost found me if it wasn't for you."
67,Kotaro,"But, why are you running away from your family?"
68,Sakura,My family has a tradition where everyone must follow a path dictated by their parents and… I don't want that.
69,Sakura,"I want to have my life, with my goals and dreams... But all they want for me is to continue the family business with my brother."
70,,Sakura tells Kotaro more about her life.
71,,"Meanwhile, Sayumi and Haruna are outside the room listening to the conversation."
72,Sayumi,Now it all makes sense...
73,Haruna,"What do you mean, Sayumi?"
74,Sayumi,"This girl is not just any person, her name is Ikuta Sakura."
75,Sayumi,"She is the daughter of one of the biggest businessmen in the country, especially after World War II."
76,Haruna,"This is strange, a girl with so much money coming here… Did Kotaro already explain to her what is this place?"
77,Sayumi,I don't think so. But let's hear some more.
78,Sayumi,"We have to be careful, if this girl ran away, I guarantee that several people are after her right now and that can cause us problems."
79,Sakura,"Kotaro, I need to ask you big favor... I don't want anyone to find me."
80,Sakura,"Please, don't tell Sayumi and Haruna what I told you for now… I'll talk to them when I'm ready."
81,Kotaro,Right. We need a name for you in the meantime...
82,Sakura,How about Ayumi? Ayumi is a beautiful name!
83,,"Sakura starts to smile, like she's just relaxing and having fun, even with a very serious subject."
84,Kotaro,"Agreed, let's call you Ayumi."
85,,"Meanwhile, Sayumi and Haruna enter the room to talk to them."
86,Haruna,Kotaru-kun!
87,Sayumi,You look better now. Did you sleep well?
88,Ayumi,"Yes, I'm much better now Sayumi-chan! Thanks for asking!"
89,Sayumi,"What's your name?"
90,Haruna,"That's right, you haven't said your name yet!"
91,Ayumi,So...
92,Kotaro,Her name is Ayumi. Right?
93,Ayumi,"Yes, my name is Ayumi."
94,Sayumi,"Nice to meet you, Ayumi-chan. I am sorry to be straight with you, we keep no secrets here. I hope you understand."
95,Haruna,"By the way… Kotaro-kun, did you talk to Ayumi-chan about what we do here?"
96,Ayumi,What do you mean? Isn't this a clock fixing shop?
97,Kotaro,"The store is just a facade… Ayumi, the truth is that this is a brothel."
98,Kotaro,"We work in the morning and afternoon like a normal shop, but that doesn't make enough money for us all to survive."
99,Sayumi,"Are you sure you still want to be here, even though you know it?!"
100,Ayumi,So it means that…
101,Haruna,That's exactly what you're thinking… Me and Sayumi are prostitute and Kotaro is responsible for running the place.
102,Sayumi,You didn't answer my question…
103,,"Ayumi stands thoughtfully for a while, looking like several thoughts were in her mind at the same time."
104,Ayumi,What I need to do?
105,,Everyone is surprised by the answer.
106,Sayumi,What?!
107,Haruna,You mean that...
108,Ayumi,"Yes, I'll stay with you. Maybe I can help with somethings!"
109,,"Everyone starts to smile and try to understand a little of what is going on in her head, but only time will tell."
110,Kotaro,Well.... Welcome!
111,,Everyone continues to chat happily with the new company.
112,,After a while everyone will go to their rooms to rest that tomorrow will be a new day.
